                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    A: Custom orders (e.g., printed or special sizes) are typically shipped within 2–5 business days.
                    The actual delivery time depends on the destination and the courier's delivery efficiency. An
                    estimated delivery date will be displayed at checkout.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    A: Once your order is shipped, a shipping confirmation with a tracking number will be sent via
                    email. You can enter this number on the courier's website (e.g., UPS) to track your order. Please
                    note that tracking information usually updates within 24 hours after shipment.

                    A: Delays in tracking updates at international transit points (e.g., customs, transfer centers) are
                    normal. If there is no update for over 5 business days, please contact us immediately. We will

                    We will also coordinate with the courier to expedite delivery and may offer compensation or discount
                    coupons for affected orders.
