                The idea behind Incutsom didn’t come from a boardroom. It came from a sun-soaked living room in
                midsummer, our founder sat struggling to install a generic curtain over an oddly-shaped window in his
                parents' aging home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun poured in each afternoon. The temperature soared. And the off-the-shelf solutions didn’t fit —
                not in size, not in look, and definitely not in feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                He knew what a skilled pair of hands could create when given the right tools and a clear vision. And in
                that moment of discomfort and determination, a new idea was born:
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold italic">
                What if everyone in the world could afford a cover that actually fits? Not just physically, but
                personally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incutsom started with that simple question and grew into a mission:
                To make made-to-measure covers for real people, real homes, and real conditions — no matter where they
                live.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our products are built in a small workshop — now transformed with advanced cutting and sewing
                technology, eco-certified fabrics, and a team of artisans who share the same belief:
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold italic">
                “Mass production doesn’t have to mean soulless. Customization doesn’t have to mean expensive.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Every shade we cut, every stitch we sew, and every box we ship carries a bit of that original spirit — a
                reminder that homes are personal, and the things we place in them should be too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Incutsom serves customers in over 20 countries. But we still operate with that same
                family-workshop heart — listening, adjusting, crafting.
            </p>

                ✅ Our mission is clear:
            </p>
            <p class="font-medium">
                To bring the power of customization to everyone — by combining factory precision, human care, and a
                commitment to sustainable living.
